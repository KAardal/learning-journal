#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 10

Week 2 is in the books. this week was challenging. The last three labs kicked my ass. They were all doable, and it was very rewarding when they were completed, but there were definitely moments where I felt incredibly lost. I'm really digging function programming. It can be a lot to wrap your head around, but
i think it's starting to become more clear. I watched a few videos about functional programming on the youtube series funfunfunction that really helped to make more sense of it. Only one more week until project week, WTF?
