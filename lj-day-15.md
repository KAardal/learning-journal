#LJ CODE 201 - DAY 15

Looking forward to project week. I got put on the D&D project. I don't know shit about D&D, but we're gonna kill it. It's really cool that Ben is passionate about this project. It makes me super stoked to work on it. He said he's going to give us a crash course on D&D on Monday, which should help because I'm clueless when it comes to that kind of thing. I don't even play video games, much less table top type games. That being said, one of the dudes on my team makes me uncomfortable as fuck. I can't yet tell if it's truly a mental health issue, or just attention seeking behavior. Either way, the dude definitely has me on guard. For now I'm going to be cautiously optimistic that home boy will settle into the group, and chill the fuck out.
