#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 06

I had a realization this weekend about just how little I know. This is good in that it means that I am learning. The more you learn about something, the more you come to understand just how little You actually know about it. But damn if it's not a bit discouraging. I hear this feeling comes in cycles. So will almost certainly have the displeasure of this experience again.

I got the navigation on my portfolio working. It was something really dumb. In my infinite wisdom I, for some really good reason, put the same class on my divs and the item in my nav bar. So when I hid the divs, so did the nav bar items. It was super sweet. But it's fixed now, so Yeah!
