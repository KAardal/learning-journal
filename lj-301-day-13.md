# LJ CODE 301 - DAY 13

I just met a guy on the ferry named Adam. Adam was sitting across from me and it was very clear that he had a sight impairment. He was struggling to read whatever mobile site he had visited on his phone. I introduced myself as a web development student, and asked if he was willing to talk about mobile app accessibility. The conversation that we had basically boiled down to zooming. He would like apps to allow him to zoom in, and remain zoomed while he continued to browse the page. The second, and in his opinion more important feature, is that the text would scale with the rest of the page when zooming. He is an avid hiker, and uses various mapping applications. Evidently, when zooming, the text on most of these apps remains the same size. Adam said that most of the time, the reason he tried to zoom in the first place was to be able to read to name of the trail, street, etc.. Apparently even Google maps is an offender in this regard.
