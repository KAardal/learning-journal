#LJ Code 201 - Day 03  

We covered loops and arrays today. It was mostly review, but it's good to revisit these topics, and also learn the ways that JS differs from what I am used to. I am having a bit of a hard time adjusting to a weakly typed language, but at the same time it's kinda nice. Makes me feel like a bit of a rebel disregarding all those rules I learned about declaring the data types and scope of variables.

I still don't love CSS, but after seeing the box model it finally started to make some semblance of sense. I'm hoping that with a little more practiced it'll finally click, and I can be not bad at it.
