#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 05

So we've been thrown a lot of new material. I am beginning to feel a little overwhelmed, but I have to just keep my head down and continue pushing forward. That being said, I think things are going pretty well. I'm digging jQuery, and looking forward to working with SQL in the coming week. I am still enjoying the format of this class. The pair programming exercises has been a very positive experience so far.

I am feeling a little anxious about my portfolio project. I'm having a bit of trouble striking a balance between making it the way that I want it to be, and fulfilling the grading requirements. Sometimes I feel that I get stuck in limbo between the two. It's like one side get sacrificed for the other, and no real progress gets made. But I guess in the big picture even a little progress is better than none, so I just have to keep at it.
