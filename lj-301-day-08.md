#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 08

I'm super stoked about setting up and working with databases. This is some seriously uncharted territory for me. I was introduced to SQL in college, basically just what it was and a few commands. I never got a chance to really use it. But at least I've seen the syntax before. Any, I'm really looking forward to the next couple of days.

Lab 8 went well. I was kind of worried about it because it was talked up to be super hard. While it was challenging, and maybe a bit time consuming, it wasn't too bad. I definitely helped me gain a more complete understanding of how the back-end of our blog app is going to work.
