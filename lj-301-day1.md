#LJ Code 301 - Day 01

Day one was good, if not a bit overwhelming. This course looks to be significantly harder than 201, which is welcomed yet intimidating. I'm really looking forward to learning responsive web design. I have used Bootstrap in the past, but I had no freaking idea how it worked, and could never get it quite right. It will be cool to be able to understand what all is going on under the hood when it comes to mobile first development.
