#LJ Code 201 - Day 11

I'm working on the bus mall project, and I cant get the damn thing to work. Everything was going fine until i tried to get the number of times an item was clicked to work. I think the problem is poor planning on my part, and I may need to start all over, but I really don't want to do that because the rest of my code is decent. It sucks. As soon as I think that I have a work around figured out, that work around ends up breaking the code somewhere else. It is super frustrating.
