#LJ CODE 201 - DAY 16

So I'm writing this a day late, but Monday was dope. we crushed it on day one of project week, basically getting to our MVP by the end of the day. I was super apprehensive about working in groups. I guess I felt that if I were to fail, I would want it to be my own doing. But it was actually awesome. Tim and I were clicking and before I knew it we pretty much had the thing finished. We stayed on the same page with function and variable names, so whenever we merged our code together it just worked. it was sweet.
