# LJ CODE 301 - DAY 15

We are officially in project week! I'm really happy with the team we have, and I'm super exited about our project. We are using the Seattle Public Library's API to make the checkout history of every book in the system available to the public. I am an avid reader, and libraries are like one of my happy places, so this project is something that I actually care about. Which is cool. Looking forward to next week.
