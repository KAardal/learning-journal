#LJ Code 201 - Day 05  

Things are good. The lab review today was awesome. It's really helpful to watch someone who knows what they're doing write code. I can pick up on code conventions and see ways of solving problems that I wouldn't have been able to come up with on my own. Reading good code is helpful, but being able to actively watch the thought process of writing good code is invaluable. It also raises all kinds of questions that maybe go beyond the current topics, but that I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. I've started writing them in my notes so I can look it up later.  

I also really enjoyed the lab today, the problems were fun little brain teasers. But more importantly, after completing it, I am finally feeling comfortable using GIT and am getting used to the work flow. I'm guessing that was the main intention of the lab.
