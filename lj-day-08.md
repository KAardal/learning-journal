# LJ CODE 201 - Day 08  

Day 08 went well. Did some event handling. I've had a bit of experience with event listeners using Swing in Java. In case you are uninitiated, Swing is retarded. So events weren't brand new material. Speaking of Java. First, I found this kick ass article on the Mozilla Developer Network that spells out most of the major differences between JS and Java. It answered so many questions! Some that I didn't even know that I had yet. Also, when I started this class I kept thinking that I knew how to do something, or what a particular thing that we were talking about was, only to quickly learn that JS did it differently. It was pissing me off. But the more that I learn JS, the more I realize that it is the language that I wished Java was when I was taking it in college. All the obscure, bullshit little rules that Java has are gone. And that is a glorious thing. Not using classes still fucks with my head, and I'll probably still make the error of declaring my number variables as ints or floats, or whatever. But I'm really starting to embrace JavaScript. Good shit.
