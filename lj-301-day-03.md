#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 03

Day 3 went really well. Believe it or not, I think I'm starting to get a handle on this event listener thing.The lab was challenging, but in a good way. I really enjoyed it. Also, I am really liking the style of these labs. Being presented with a code base, and a list of problems makes me feel like I'm solving real world problems. Don't get me wrong, creating something from scratch is awesome. But it's nice to not have to be as concerned with the whole picture, and just focus on the small problems one at a time.

My portfolio is not where I would like it to be at the moment, but it's pretty close. I planned on putting some serious work into it last night, but life had different plans for me. C'est la vie.
