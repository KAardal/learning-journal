#LJ Code 201 - Day 13

So we're more than half way through now. The class is moving at a brisk pace, but I feel like I'm keeping up with the concepts fairly well. A few months ago I built a static website for my restaurant. I revisited that site last night, and let me tell you, it's hot garbage. But it was interesting to compare what I knew then, and what I know now. I'm definitely going to re-do the site when I'm finished with this class.
