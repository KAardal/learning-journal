#LJ CODE 301 - DAY 11

Today's lab was deceptively easy. I had a hard time excepting that we had finished it. To be honest, I'm still not convinced. I think because the last lab put us through the grinder, so to speak, it made it feel like a trick when we finished in 45 minutes.

I got a taste of MVC in college. Basically a glossed over, "This is what it is and why", and that was that. I'm looking forward to implementing it and making "real" applications.
