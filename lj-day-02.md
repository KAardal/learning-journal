#LJ Code 201 - Day 2  

Things are going well so far. The 'About Me' project went well. Even though we haven't really covered them yet, I used functions to avoid pasting the same code over and over again. I just couldn't do it. I am becoming more comfortable using JS, but the CSS is still a beast. CSS is definitely a weak point, and I'll have to work on getting it up to speed. I have experience programming in Java, which definitely helps with the fundamentals of programming. but I am running into some issues where I know what I want to do, but I just don't know how, or if I even can do it in JS. I'm sure more immersion in the language will remedy the problem.
