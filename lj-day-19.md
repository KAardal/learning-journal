#LJ CODE 201 - DAY 19

It's presentation day. I'm a little nervous, but I think we'll be fine. Our project works, for the moment at least. I'm not super stoked with the styling, but whatever. We ran into some merging issues yesterday that derailed our progress for a few hours. One of our members didn't fully understand the git process, and was merging dead, and duplicate code into the master branch. It took a long time to get it sorted out, time that would have been better spent on CSS.
